It presents a systematic literature review of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) applications in recommender systems, covering key
concepts, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. It discusses how MAB algorithms are used in recommender systems, their
empirical evaluation, and their approach to classic challenges like data sparsity, scalability, cold-start, privacy, and
explainability. The survey provides a detailed analysis of MAB's role in addressing these challenges and identifies
future research directions, emphasizing the need for innovative algorithms and evaluation criteria that better reflect
the goals of recommender systems.
