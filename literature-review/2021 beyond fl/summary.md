It discusses the increasing interest in federated machine learning frameworks for smart manufacturing, emphasizing the
need
for confidentiality in distributed data sources. It highlights the limitations of current federated learning frameworks
in industrial settings due to assumptions on data sources. The paper proposes a confidentiality-preserving approach for
smart manufacturing using transfer learning, implemented on a module-based platform. The work includes discussions on
confidentiality and privacy in industrial contexts, differential privacy for protecting data, and the challenges of
transfer learning. The proposed platform aims to combine transfer learning with confidentiality-preserving mechanisms to
address the mismatch between training and application data in industrial settings.
