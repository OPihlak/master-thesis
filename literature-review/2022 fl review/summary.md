It provides a comprehensive overview of Federated Learning (FL), starting from its fundamental concepts, underlying
technologies,
architectures, system challenges, to privacy-preserving methods. It emphasizes FL's role in improving a wide range of
applications since its introduction by Google, particularly in Androidâ€™s Gboard and Google Assistant. The review
highlights FL as a collaborative, on-device machine learning setting that enhances data privacy and security by allowing
data to remain decentralized. The paper categorizes FL into three architectures: Vertical FL, Horizontal FL, and
Federated Transfer Learning, each suited to different data sharing and collaboration scenarios. It also addresses system
challenges in FL, such as device reliability, data imbalance, and communication costs, offering solutions to mitigate
these issues. Furthermore, the review explores current and future applications of FL across various sectors, including
artificial intelligence, IoT, blockchain, natural language processing, autonomous vehicles, and resource allocation,
highlighting the technology's expansive impact and potential growth areas.
