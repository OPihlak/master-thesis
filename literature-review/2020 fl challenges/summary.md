It provides a comprehensive overview of federated learning, a method of training machine learning models across many
devices while keeping data localized. It
discusses the unique challenges of federated learning, including expensive communication, systems heterogeneity,
statistical heterogeneity, and privacy concerns. The paper also reviews current approaches to these challenges and
suggests future research directions. Federated learning is differentiated from traditional distributed machine learning
due to its focus on privacy and local data processing, requiring new methods in distributed optimization, machine
learning, and privacy-preserving data analysis.
