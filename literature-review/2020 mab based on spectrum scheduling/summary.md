Iteviews the use of
multi-armed bandit (MAB) methods in spectrum scheduling for wireless networks. It explains the challenges in assigning
frequency bands in wireless networks, especially under uncertainty conditions, and how MAB techniques can be applied to
address these challenges. The survey categorizes the spectrum scheduling problems into single-player and multi-player
MAB models, and centralized versus decentralized approaches. It reviews various algorithms, categorizing them based on
the MAB model they use and their approach to handling interference among users. The survey also discusses complexities,
regret bounds of these algorithms, and potential future research directions, including learning with budget constraints,
observation sharing among users, and fault tolerance in uncertain environments.
